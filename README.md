My name is Pietro Grassani and this is my "DH and cultural heritage" exam project. It's titled "Calvino e le citt√† (in)visibili" and it's about Italo Calvino's representation of
real and fictional cities and it aims at expanding our idea of the writer as a sort of "urbanistic utopian", since he wasn't just that: he also drew from his personal experiences
in order to write about the fast changes of post-war Italy, and obviously urban arias were a big part of that. The project is an incomplete - but expandable - collection of documents
(texts, images, videos...), some of which have been already implemented, some of which will someday possibly will. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS and Jquery for the interface,
while I chose XML/RDF (+FRBR and DC) for resources' metadata and XML/TEI for the text mark-up. I hope someone will enjoy my project.
